# ExpenseTracker

Android studio, Firebase


Expense tracker is an advanced system that allows users to efficiently manage his/her expenses with ease. Tracking expenses daily helps us save a lot of money. Once we start off by tracking our costs each day, we will be able to get a better idea of where you are spending your money, so you stay in control and achieve your goal. It will be able to generate your expense and saving report as the time duration you selected. There will be a reminder that will help to save money for your pre-defined expenses.
